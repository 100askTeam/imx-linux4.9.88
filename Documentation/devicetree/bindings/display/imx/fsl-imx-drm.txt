Freescale i.MX DRM master device
================================

The freescale i.MX DRM master device is a virtual device needed to list all
IPU or other display interface nodes that comprise the graphics subsystem.

Required properties:
- compatible: Should be "fsl,imx-display-subsystem"
- ports: Should contain a list of phandles pointing to display interface ports
  of IPU devices

example:

display-subsystem {
	compatible = "fsl,display-subsystem";
	ports = <&ipu_di0>;
};


Freescale i.MX IPUv3
====================

Required properties:
- compatible: Should be "fsl,<chip>-ipu"
- reg: should be register base and length as documented in the
  datasheet
- interrupts: Should contain sync interrupt and error interrupt,
  in this order.
- resets: phandle pointing to the system reset controller and
          reset line index, see reset/fsl,imx-src.txt for details
Optional properties:
- port@[0-3]: Port nodes with endpoint definitions as defined in
  Documentation/devicetree/bindings/media/video-interfaces.txt.
  Ports 0 and 1 should correspond to CSI0 and CSI1,
  ports 2 and 3 should correspond to DI0 and DI1, respectively.

example:

ipu: ipu@18000000 {
	#address-cells = <1>;
	#size-cells = <0>;
	compatible = "fsl,imx53-ipu";
	reg = <0x18000000 0x080000000>;
	interrupts = <11 10>;
	resets = <&src 2>;

	ipu_di0: port@2 {
		reg = <2>;

		ipu_di0_disp0: endpoint {
			remote-endpoint = <&display_in>;
		};
	};
};

Freescale i.MX DPU
====================

Required properties:
- compatible: Should be "fsl,<chip>-dpu"
- reg: should be register base and length as documented in the
  datasheet
- intsteer: phandle pointing to interrupt steer.
- interrupts, interrupt-names: Should contain interrupts and names as
  documented in the datasheet.
- clocks, clock-names: phandles to the DPU clocks described in
  Documentation/devicetree/bindings/clock/clock-bindings.txt
  The following clocks are expected on i.MX8qm and i.MX8qxp:
           "pll0" - PLL clock for display interface 0
           "pll1" - PLL clock for display interface 1
           "disp0" - pixel clock for display interface 0
           "disp1" - pixel clock for display interface 1
  The needed clock numbers for each are documented in
  Documentation/devicetree/bindings/clock/imx8qm-clock.txt, and in
  Documentation/devicetree/bindings/clock/imx8qxp-clock.txt.
- power-domains: phandle pointing to power domain.
Optional properties:
- port@[0-1]: Port nodes with endpoint definitions as defined in
  Documentation/devicetree/bindings/media/video-interfaces.txt.
  ports 0 and 1 should correspond to display interface 0 and
  display interface 1, respectively.

example:

dpu: dpu@56180000 {
	#address-cells = <1>;
	#size-cells = <0>;
	compatible = "fsl,imx8qm-dpu";
	reg = <0x0 0x56180000 0x0 0x40000>;
	intsteer = <&dpu1_intsteer>;
	interrupts = <GIC_SPI 40 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>,
		     <GIC_SPI 41 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>,
		     <GIC_SPI 42 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>,
		     <GIC_SPI 43 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>,
		     <GIC_SPI 44 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>,
		     <GIC_SPI 45 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>,
		     <GIC_SPI 46 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>,
		     <GIC_SPI 47 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
	interrupt-names = "irq_common",
			  "irq_stream0a",
			  "irq_stream0b",
			  "irq_stream1a",
			  "irq_stream1b",
			  "irq_reserved0",
			  "irq_reserved1",
			  "irq_blit";
	clocks = <&clk IMX8QM_DC0_PLL0_CLK>,
		 <&clk IMX8QM_DC0_PLL1_CLK>,
		 <&clk IMX8QM_DC0_DISP0_CLK>,
		 <&clk IMX8QM_DC0_DISP1_CLK>;
	clock-names = "pll0", "pll1", "disp0", "disp1";
	power-domains = <&pd_dc0>;

	dpu1_disp1: port@1 {
		reg = <1>;

		dpu1_disp1_lvds0: lvds0-endpoint {
			remote-endpoint = <&ldb1_lvds0>;
		};

		dpu1_disp1_lvds1: lvds1-endpoint {
			remote-endpoint = <&ldb1_lvds1>;
		};
	};
};

Parallel display support
========================

Required properties:
- compatible: Should be "fsl,imx-parallel-display"
Optional properties:
- interface_pix_fmt: How this display is connected to the
  display interface. Currently supported types: "rgb24", "rgb565", "bgr666"
  and "lvds666".
- edid: verbatim EDID data block describing attached display.
- ddc: phandle describing the i2c bus handling the display data
  channel
- port@[0-1]: Port nodes with endpoint definitions as defined in
  Documentation/devicetree/bindings/media/video-interfaces.txt.
  Port 0 is the input port connected to the IPU display interface,
  port 1 is the output port connected to a panel.

example:

display@di0 {
	compatible = "fsl,imx-parallel-display";
	edid = [edid-data];
	interface-pix-fmt = "rgb24";

	port@0 {
		reg = <0>;

		display_in: endpoint {
			remote-endpoint = <&ipu_di0_disp0>;
		};
	};

	port@1 {
		reg = <1>;

		display_out: endpoint {
			remote-endpoint = <&panel_in>;
		};
	};
};

panel {
	...

	port {
		panel_in: endpoint {
			remote-endpoint = <&display_out>;
		};
	};
};
